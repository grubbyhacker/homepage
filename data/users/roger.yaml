  - author: "Goethe"
    text: > 
      The world is so empty if one thinks only of mountains, rivers & cities;
      but to know someone who thinks & feels with us, & who, though distant, 
      is close to us in spirit, this makes the earth for us an inhabited garden.
  - author: "Ernest Hemingway"
    citation: "Islands in the Stream"
    text: >
      He thought that on the ship he could come to some terms with
      his sorrow, not knowing, yet, that there are no terms to be
      made with sorrow.
  - author: "Herman Hesse"
    citation: "Demian"
    text: >
      I live in my dreams â€” that's what you sense. Other people live
      in dreams, but not in their own. That's the difference.
